# Child Theme

## What's a child theme and why do I need one?

Basically, a child theme is a theme that inherits the functionality and styling of the parent theme. Child themes are recommended to modify existing themes while still maintaining their design and code.

Creating a child theme allows you to modify the parent theme without losing your customizations. Without a child theme, you'd have to modify the parent theme's files directly whenever you wanted to make a change. This means that whenever you update the parent theme, all of your changes would be overwritten.
